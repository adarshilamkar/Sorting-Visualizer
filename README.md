Sorting Visualizer
Introduction
The Sorting Visualizer is a web-based tool built with JavaScript that helps users visualize various sorting algorithms in action. This tool provides a visual representation of how different algorithms sort a list of numbers, making it easier to understand the underlying concepts.

Features
Multiple Sorting Algorithms: Includes visualization for algorithms like Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and more.
Customizable Array Size: Adjust the size of the array to see how the sorting process scales.
Adjustable Sorting Speed: Change the speed of the visualization to analyze the algorithms in detail.
Real-time Visualization: See how the array elements are being compared, swapped, and sorted in real-time.
Responsive Design: The visualizer works well on various screen sizes, including mobile devices.
Technologies Used
HTML: For the structure of the web page.
CSS: For styling and layout.
JavaScript: For implementing the sorting algorithms and handling the visualization logic.
